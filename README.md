#3D printer / CNC Mainboard
A main-board for a 3d printer or CNC with wide possibilities with the use of the expansion board and thermister boards to not get locked in to one type of thermister or display. I started this design to place it into my Ultimaker 2+ for better Stepper drivers and more options. Also in the future I want to make a cnc and this would be the perfect board for this application. This whole idea started about the 15 of December very close to the deadline of blueprint, recently it got extended but its still a LOT to do. For compatibility i went with overkill amounts of everything and some expansion headers. Also because there are a lot of different thermister available i made an port for a thermister board where you could place the board for your thermister to have wide compatibility. There are also a bunch of extra stuff: 5x Stepper motor drivers 4x Bed / Nozzle heater output 4x Fan / Led output 4x End stops 3x Thermisters 3x Thermister boards 1x Expansion port (for displays, sd card readers or extra stuf)
