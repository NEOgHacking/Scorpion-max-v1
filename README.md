A main-board for a 3d printer or CNC with wide possibilities with the use of the expansion board and thermister boards to not get locked in to one type of thermister or display. I started this design to place it into my Ultimaker 2+ for better Stepper drivers and more options. Also in the future I want to make a cnc and this would be the perfect board for this application. This whole idea started about the 15 of December very close to the deadline of blueprint, recently it got extended but its still a LOT to do. For compatibility i went with overkill amounts of everything and some expansion headers. Also because there are a lot of different thermister available i made an port for a thermister board where you could place the board for your thermister to have wide compatibility. There are also a bunch of extra stuff: 5x Stepper motor drivers 4x Bed / Nozzle heater output 4x Fan / Led output 4x End stops 3x Thermisters 3x Thermister boards 1x Expansion port (for displays, sd card readers or extra stuf)

# Reason
So long story longer I have an ultimaker 2+ laying at home doing nothing because of the noisy stepper drivers and recently getting an ultimaker S5 so I wanted to make it quieter and more useful. I was amazed by the Prusa mini being so quiet so I thought why not build my own mainboard, also I am planing to build a CNC somewhere in the future so I thought it would be a genius idea to build my own 3D printer / CNC mainboard with my own overkill specs and the best stepper drivers.

# Specs
5x Stepper driver TMC2130
4x Power Mosfets for controlling beds, heaters, ext.
4x Fan controller with tacho input
4x Limit switches for homing
3x Thermister inputs with possibilities for NTC's and PTC's
2x Safety inputs for disabling cutting power via a relay to the stepper drivers and mosfets
Expansion port for displays, sd cards, ext.
STM32H743VIT6 for big storage and calculation power
Standard 4 pin power connector and 2 pin screw terminal
